# Fork of aframe-guassian-splatting to try UGC splats

I am doing a lot of trial and error and "hacking" with services like polycam or lumlabs to get the splat from them and hope it works.

This repo is to share with others to help debug and includes a few sample files.

## Seal Splat - SF Giant's Lou Seal statue
* luma-seal.splat - generated by LumaLabsAI from a video taken by me and downloaded from Luma as .splat file. Capture here: https://lumalabs.ai/capture/87c3e8bc-374c-4ebe-9a04-7b00fc110514
* polycam-seal.splat - generated by Polycam from still photos taken by me and downloaded from Polycam as a .splat file by intercepting the splat downloading via the Polycam viewer: https://poly.cam/capture/a7dd5e33-05ec-43a1-a5b9-abc655ad5885



## aframe-gaussian-splatting-component

This component is an A-Frame implementation of real-time rendering for [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).  
This code is derived from the WebGL implementation developed by [antimatter15](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat).

### Demo page

Needs few seconds to load sploats.

### Properties

| Property  | Description                 | Default Value |
| --------  | -----------                 | ------------- |
| src       | url of splat or ply file    | train.splat   |


### Usage

#### Browser Installation

Install and use by directly including the file.
