## aframe-gaussian-splatting-component

This component is an A-Frame implementation of real-time rendering for [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).  
This code is derived from the WebGL implementation developed by [antimatter15](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat).

### Demo page

Needs few seconds to load sploats.  
https://quadjr.github.io/aframe-gaussian-splatting/

### Properties

| Property  | Description                 | Default Value |
| --------  | -----------                 | ------------- |
| src       | url of splat or ply file    | train.splat   |
| cutoutEntity | selector to a box primitive that uses scale and position to define the bounds of splat points to render    |     |

### Seal Splat - SF Giant's Lou Seal statue
* luma-seal.splat - generated by [LumaLabsAI](https://lumalabs.ai/) from a video taken by @kfarr and downloaded from Luma (see workflow notes below). Capture here: https://lumalabs.ai/capture/87c3e8bc-374c-4ebe-9a04-7b00fc110514
* polycam-seal.splat - generated by Polycam from still photos and downloaded from Polycam: https://poly.cam/capture/a7dd5e33-05ec-43a1-a5b9-abc655ad5885

### Example custom scan to gaussian splat workflow
* Use https://lumalabs.ai/ to process a scan, I have found video to work very well
* Go to download dialog and choose Gaussian > Splat (which will actually download a .zip file with a .ply file inside).
* Use this site to convert the ply to splat in the browser: https://splat-converter.glitch.me/ by @akbartus (repo https://github.com/akbartus/Gaussian-Splatting-WebViewers/tree/main/splat_converter)
* Use resultant .splat in the A-Frame scene

If using Polycam, we found success in downloading the .splat by finding URL in browser network console when viewing with the Polycam viewer. (There is probably a better way.)

### Usage

#### Browser Installation

Install and use by directly including the file.
About the splat file, please refer [antimatter15](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat).
